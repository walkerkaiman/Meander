# OSC Mode: Set to 'true' for multicast, 'false' for unicast (direct IP)
# Unicast is simpler and more reliable for single receivers
OSC_MULTICAST=false

# OSC_HOST: IP address of your OSC receiver
# When OSC_MULTICAST=false (unicast mode):
#   Set this to the IP address of your OSC receiver device
#   Example: 192.168.1.100 (replace with your OSC receiver's IP)
#   For broadcast to entire subnet, use: 192.168.1.255 (replace with your subnet)
#
# When OSC_MULTICAST=true (multicast mode):
#   Use a multicast group address like: 239.0.0.1
#   Your OSC listeners must JOIN this multicast group to receive messages
#
# IMPORTANT: Replace the IP below with your actual OSC receiver's IP address!
