For Interactive Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Backend

1. States & Visuals
Scene (includes Opening & Ending)

Media Display:

Fullscreen image or video (autoplay, loop, no controls, scaled to fill screen).

If multiple media files exist: use the first item only.

Fallback: black fullscreen background.

Overlays: none.

Transitions: crossfade from previous state to new media (0.5s recommended).

Fork

Notification: Device vibrates once on entry.

UI Elements:

Countdown timer: centered, bold, high-contrast text.

Choice buttons:

Evenly distributed across screen space.

Size dynamically based on number of options (minimum 44px height, WCAG).

Highlighted state when tapped/selected.

Background: black

Interaction Rules:

User can tap/change selection multiple times until timer expires.

Hover feedback (desktop) and tap highlight feedback (mobile).

At expiration: automatically lock selection and send vote.

2. Interaction

Choice Selection:

User taps a choice button → highlight changes to that button.

Deselection not needed; tapping another overrides previous.

Feedback:

Visual highlight (e.g., border glow or fill color).

Optional haptic vibration on selection.

Submission:

Automatically sent when timer expires (/audience/vote).

If user has not selected, send “no vote” value.

3. Timing Rules

Countdown Format: 05, 04, etc. (SS).

Timer Behavior:

If user loads page mid-countdown, show current remaining time (provided by timerTick message).

UI updates every second (or per timerTick messages).

End of Timer: lock UI, send vote, gray out buttons

4. Responsiveness

Layouts:

Portrait: vertical stacking of choices (buttons fill width, evenly spaced down page).

Landscape: horizontal or grid layout (buttons evenly spaced side-by-side).

Font & Button Sizes:

Minimum 16px font size.

Choice buttons minimum 44px tall (touch accessible).

Timer text: at least 8% of screen width, bold, centered.

Rotation: smooth reflow on orientation change, preserving active state/selection.

5. Networking

Messages from Server (via WebSockets):

stateChanged → triggers Scene or Fork rendering.

voteTick → optional updates during voting.

voteResult → optional display of outcomes (not required in base spec).

timerTick → updates countdown timer.

Client → Server Endpoints:

/audience/vote (POST): sends { choiceId, userId/sessionId }.

Background: black.

Text: white, high-contrast.

Choice buttons:

Animations:

Smooth button highlight transitions (≤150ms).

Fade-in for scenes/forks.

7. Summary of User Flow
